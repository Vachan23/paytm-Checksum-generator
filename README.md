# paytm-Checksum-generator
For paytm POS integration, a checksum is required for authentication. This will help you generate the checksum.
I am recieving and sending the response according to my convinience. 
This helps me in generating a checksum and send it to my cache function, where I am consuming the payTM API for sending a request to the POS machine.
